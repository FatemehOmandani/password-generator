Code Overview
Password Generation
The JavaScript file (index.js) contains a list of possible characters including letters, numbers, and symbols. The password is generated by selecting random characters from this list based on the selected length.

Copy to Clipboard
The application uses the navigator.clipboard.writeText() method to copy the password text. This function is executed when you click on either of the generated passwords.
